# TODO: is it possible to run this workflow only if the check-code-quality workflow has completed successfully ?
# I've tried workflow_run but see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run
# Note: This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch.

# Run workflow only for new git tags (including hierarchical tags like v1.0/beta), or manually
